# Electronics Retailer Project

Welcome to my Excel Data Analysis Portfolio project! This repository contains a dashboard made using Excel.

This project serves as a demonstration of my Excel skills for data analysis. It highlights what I've learned thus far within Excel regarding data manipulation, visualisation, and reporting.

## Overview

The highly polished dashboard summarises and illustrates data from electronics retailer in an easy-to-read format, facilitating data-driven decision-making.

The dashboard is intuitive and simple to navigate around, thanks to the straightforward menu UI and filters.

The first page delves into the sources of income, depicting breakdowns by product category as well as various averages and totals for a set time period.

The second page focuses on retail stores throughout the world and includes income breakdowns for each country, as well as maps and charts.

**Notice:** *The dashboard is meant to be looked at in full-screen mode without a formula bar, sheet tabs, or scroll bars.*
